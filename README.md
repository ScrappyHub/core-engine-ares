# CORE ENGINE — ARES (Acoustic Resonance)

ARES is a deterministic physics engine focused on acoustic wave behavior:
- propagation, reflection, absorption
- standing waves, modal maps
- Q-factor, resonance peaks

## Non-negotiables
- Deterministic + reproducible outputs
- Headless runnable (CLI)
- Produces signed/hashed artifacts (conditions, outputs, checksums)
- No identity, no auth, no governance authority

## Governance & Authority
ARES inherits platform authority from: CORE Platform.
This repo defines physics execution only.
