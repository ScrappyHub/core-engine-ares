# 🔊 CORE ENGINE — ARES GOVERNANCE (CANONICAL)

File: `verticals/ares/CORE_ARES_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md`  
Engine Key: **ARES**  
Authority Level: Engine Governance (Binding)  
Status: ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL  

## 1. Authority & Inheritance

ARES is permanently bound by CORE platform governance:
- Stop Layer, Constitution, Registry Law, Governance Index, Engine Registry Contract

ARES defines physics execution only.

## 2. Scope (What ARES Is)

ARES models acoustic wave behavior:
- propagation, reflection, absorption
- standing waves and modal maps
- harmonic peaks and Q-factor estimates
- pressure/velocity fields (where applicable)

## 3. Non-Scope (What ARES Is Not)

ARES may NOT:
- access sensors or devices directly without CORE orchestration
- infer cross-project identity or data
- generate non-evidence “claims” beyond computed outputs
- publish outside CORE permissions

## 4. Determinism & Reproducibility

ARES runs must be reproducible given:
- geometry/material inputs
- boundary conditions
- excitation definitions
- engine release identity

Non-deterministic modes (if any) must be explicitly labeled and logged.

## 5. Required Artifacts (Minimum Bundle)

ARES must output:
- `ENGINE_MANIFEST.json`
- `RUN_CONDITIONS.json`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- `ACOUSTIC_FIELD.json` (or equivalent structured field output)
- `MODAL_MAP.json`
- `FREQUENCY_RESPONSE.json`
- `PEAKS.json`
- `ARTIFACT_INDEX.json`

## 6. Safety & Misuse Controls

ARES must:
- label output units and constraints
- prevent “medical/biological interpretation” unless routed through governed vertical lenses
- expose uncertainty when inputs are incomplete

## 7. Publishing & Export Rules

Export requires sealed run + hashes + manifest included.

## 8. Amendment Rules

Changes require CORE governance review.
